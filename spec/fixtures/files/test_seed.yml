    from art, history, literature, music, science, technology and religion to communications,
    engineering, management and cooking. The Africana collection is a resource for
    the entire university, and most of Northwestern's disciplinary programs are reflected
    in the collection. In addition to serving the NU community, the Herskovits Library
    also serves regional, national and international scholars.
