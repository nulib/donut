wg827ks1643,Collection,Work in Progress - A Framework for Building Interactive Learning Modules,"The development of good quality educational software is expensive, time-consuming and faces some underlying issues. In order to deal with such issues, many attempts were made, mainly on code reuse. Following a similar approach, the development of an application framework for implementing a family of interactivity-intense educational software called Interactive Learning Modules – iLM is presented. The framework main goal is to reduce development efforts while being part of a Software Product Line – SPL, an innovative technique regarding interactivity-intense educational software. The framework specification is presented by analyzing the common features of existing iLM. Therefore, the resulting component architecture is outlined. Currently, the design phase is finished and the implementation ongoing. Also, its instantiation is planned for an existing iLM, as a proof of concept.", -- educational software, -- software product line, -- application framework,,,,text,"Dalmon, Danilo","Brandao, Leonidas","Brandao, Anarosa","Isotani, Seiji",,,,,,,,2011,DalmonEtAl2011_Framework_Final.pdf
wm346hj8366,Image,Knowing their lines: how social boundaries undermine equity-based integration policies in United States and South African schools,"""In this paper we argue that although the United States and South Africa have produced qualitatively different national frames about the necessity for racial integration in education, certain practices converge in both nations at the school level that thwart integrationist goals. Drawing on sociologist Jeannie Oakes and colleagues' idea of schools as """"zones of mediation""""  of economic, racial, social, and cultural phenomena, we provide empirical evidence of how a complex set of social interactions, sustained by explicit organized school practices, limit educators' and students' abilities to accept and comply with integrationist aims of equity and the redress of cumulative disadvantages due to past racial discrimination. We discuss how social and symbolic boundaries reproduced by educational actors in everyday school practices illuminate the macromicro tension between the goals of racial integration policy and perceived group interests. Our arguments emerge from thorough analyses of ethnographic, interview, and survey data obtained over a four-year period from multiracial and desegregated schools located in four US and South African cities. """, -- desegregation, -- equity, -- high-school integration, -- race, -- zones of mediation,,text,"Carter, Prudence L.","Caruthers, Jakeya ",Perspectives in Education,,,,,,,,,2009-12,
